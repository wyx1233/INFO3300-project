# Part II: Controls for Effective Communication


## Problem 1: Mutually-Exclusive Options

A user needs to select 1 out of 15 mutually-exclusive options.

**Assumptions:**
The user does not need to make many choices, except for this one question.
**Possible Controls:**
Radio button
Pros：
- Efficient: selected with one click simply
- Can present all choices together
- Provide better documentation of options without the need to click on anything
Cons:
- Take much space: can use a lot of layout area 
- The order of radio button options can convince the form used to make a selection

Combo Box/Drop-down list
Pros:
- Large capacity: can have many choices and take a small area
- Can clearly and straightforwardly see the choice 
Cons：
- Lack of overview： When there are too many options, it can be confusing and intimidating and make it difficult for users to find their choice.
- Scrolling issues: Too many options may cause the user to likely scroll down the page instead of the combo box, thus hiding the combo box from the screen. This can make it challenging to find information and to scroll precisely.
- Inconsistent user interface： The user interface for the combo box is different between browsers and operating systems, and the combo box not only looks different but works differently.

Single-selection list boxes
Pros:
- Make a form compact： take up a specific amount of space
- Low interaction cost： When there are not many selections, you only need to click once to select.
- Increased visibility of items: The ability to see all or multiple options at once speeds up decision making and improves the accuracy of selections.
- Greater visibility: Because list boxes are not limited to a single column, more options can be made visible if the width of the list box allows.

Cons:
- Screen space: Although compact, they tend to take up more screen space than combo boxes.
- Unfamiliarity: Not knowing how to interact with list boxes immediately - in particular, they may not know how to select multiple selections if they do not include checkboxes in the multi-select list box.
- May not see all selected options at the same time: If there are many more available items beyond the viewable area, users may lose the ability to see all selected items at the same time.

**Best Control:**:
Radio button: 
The user can clearly see each option. However, it may take up more space. But the cognitive burden would be less than the other two, which would likely require swiping to see the options. Moreover, our hypothesis is that the user does not need to select many options in the medium, so it does not matter much if it takes up more space.


## Problem 2: Customer Feedback

A user needs to provide feedback on customer service. You ask for their rating, ranging from 0 to 5.

**Assumptions:**
Assume that users can only score integers

**Possible Controls:**
Sliders
Pros：
- More content in less space: The slider makes parts of your content visible at different times. The advantage of this is that you can fit a lot of content into a small space. For example, if you want the user to pick the year of birth, the slider can make a collection of many years on a single bar.
- Interactive content that captures users' attention
- May show higher inter-rater reliability than using a rating scale with a limited number of choices

Cons:
- Difficult to move the sliding bar on a cell phone
- Produce more incomplete data than clickable radio buttons
- may take longer to manipulate the drag and drop slider


Pros：
- Efficient: selected with one click simply
- Can present all choices together
- Provide better documentation of options without the need to click on anything
Cons:
- Take much space: can use a lot of layout area 
- The order of radio button options can convince the form used to make a selection

Numeric textboxes
Pros:
- Can adjust to the exact option precisely
- Take a small space
Cons
- Take a lot of effort to click
- Cannot know the overview of each choice
- Hard to know the maximum input size after clicked

Drop-down list
Pros:
- Large capacity: can have many choices and take a small area
- Can clearly and straightforwardly see the choice 
Cons：
- Lack of overview： When there are too many options, it can be confusing and intimidating and make it difficult for users to find their choice.
- Scrolling issues: Too many options may cause the user to likely scroll down the page instead of the combo box, thus hiding the combo box from the screen. This can make it difficult to find information and scroll precisely.
- Inconsistent user interface： The user interface for the combo box is different between browsers and operating systems, and the combo box not only looks different but works differently.

**Best Control:**:
Drop-down list：
It is straightforward to see the upper and lower limits of the fraction. And it is already clear that you cannot type fractions that contain decimals. Also, this is the more used way, and users will intuitively know how to use it. Also, it is much fewer steps than a numeric textbox.



## Problem 3: Favorite Books

You wish to display a list of your favorite books, grouped by genre, on your personal website.

**Assumptions:**
Assume I have many favorite books


**Possible Controls:**
Drop-down lists

- Inconsistent user interface： The user interface for combo box is different between browsers and operating systems, and combo box not only look different but work differently.

Tabs
Pros
- Present more content to the user in a limited space
- Present clear categories
Cons
- Imitates content in other tabs


Checkbox lists
Pros
- Can have multiple choices
- compact in space usage
- Universal used
- present all content overview at one time
- Low interaction cost： When there are not many selections, you only need to click  to select
Cons
- Setting multiple checkboxes for a single question can take up a lot of space on the form
- The order of check box options might form users in their selection
- If there is too much information, scrolling page might cause a cognitive burden

**Best Control:**:
Tabs
Because it can display more information, each category is obvious, book categories by large categories will not be a lot. Hence, the tab just in the display of each category at the same time shows enough content. And on the web, tabs are more in line with people's habit of using the web.



## Problem 4: Multiple Categories

A user needs to select multiple categories from a list of 15 options.

**Assumptions:**
No assumption

**Best Control:**:
Checkboxes
To avoid scroll-down to see all options, the checkbox is the best choice. It can present all the options at once.



## Problem 5: Stop It!

You are building a run tracking application and need to include a button to stop tracking and complete the run. Your users have complained that they often hit the button unintentionally.

**Assumptions:**
No Assumptions


**Possible Controls:**
Drop-down list
Pros:

since the drop-down menu needs to click twice to change the choice, which could unintentionally hit the button.




## Problem 6: Searching

You have created a job search application. Some of the information comes in the form of Boolean values, such as:
- Are you eligible for employment in the US?
- Are you currently employed?
- Did you graduate from a 4-year, accredited institution?

**Assumptions:**
No assumption


**Possible Controls:**

Several Drop-down lists

**Best Control:**:
Several Drop-down lists:
1. Could push users to make these important choices
2. Could present each questions' answer clearly
3. Universal used



## Problem 7: Lots of Functions!

You've built a photo manipulation application. Once a user has a part of the image selected (you don't need to address this in your response), they need to be able to perform a selected function. There are about 15 different functions, some of which can be grouped together.

Additionally, these functions sometimes take a few seconds to complete. You will need to indicate this to the user.

**Assumptions:**
Assume the waiting time won't be longer than 4 seconds.

**Possible Controls:**
Ribbons:
Pros: 
- Discoverable
- Direct
- One place to look. 
- Great choice for complex apps with many commands
Cons: 
- Large and very heavy
- Not contextual or simple
- Having to change tabs frequently can kill productivity 

Toolbars
Pros: 
- discoverable and direct 
- Simple
Cons: 
- Not contextual 
- Not simple if there are many commands

Progress bar:
Pros：
- Provide progress feedback
- Could be fun
Cons：
- could take the whole page 

Spinners:
Pros：
- Provide progress feedback
- Straightforward 

Cons：
- might frustrate users if it appears too long



**Best Control:**:
Ribbons+ Spinner
The ribbon is a good tool to organize different features into categories. Like photoshop/ AutoCAD, which labeled each category like edit, view. And below these categories are the grouped features.
And since some functions will take time to process. A clear signifier like spinner is needed. A study found that the tolerable waiting time for users is 4 seconds. This finding implies that their behavioral intention starts to change after 4 seconds. Since we assume that the waiting time won't be longer than 4 seconds, a spinner would be enough to signify.
